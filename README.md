# MathYogi
MathYogi - a virtual math teaching assistant and math mentor. MathYogi keeps track of each step students' take and identifies their math weakness. It also shows an in-depth analysis of the weakness via graphs and charts.

## My Contributions
* Redesigned the app and coded the front end using Materialize CSS libray, HTML5.
* Wrote media queries to make the website multiple device and browser friendly and created report cards and graphs using ChartJS data visualization library.
